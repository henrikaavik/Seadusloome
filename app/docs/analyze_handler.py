"""Background job handler for ``analyze_impact``.

Pipeline (spec §7 + §8):

    1. Load the draft + every resolved reference from Postgres.
    2. Build the draft's Turtle graph via :mod:`app.docs.graph_builder`.
    3. PUT the graph into its named Jena graph.
    4. Run :class:`app.docs.impact.ImpactAnalyzer` against the graph.
    5. Compute an impact score.
    6. Persist a new ``impact_reports`` row with the full findings JSON.
    7. Flip the draft row to ``status='ready'``.

Failure modes:

    - Draft missing ⇒ ``ValueError`` (worker retries are pointless
      for a permanently-deleted draft; retries still get consumed so
      the user eventually sees the error).
    - Jena PUT fails ⇒ the whole handler raises ``RuntimeError``
      and flips the draft to ``failed``. The worker's retry loop
      picks it up — useful for transient Fuseki restarts.
    - Analyzer or scoring exception ⇒ handler flips the draft to
      ``failed``, deletes the named graph we just pushed (best
      effort, so stale data doesn't accumulate), and re-raises.

The real handler registers itself at module bottom via
``@register_handler``; importing :mod:`app.docs` wires it into the
worker's dispatch table (replacing the Phase 2 stub).
